# engineer-diploma-app

An android application made as a part of engineering thesis.

It is a simulator of some test objects used in laboratories which I encountered during studies.
Main goal was to create environment which allows students to test their automation skills at home without the need of using real machines.

App uses game engine libGDX for simulation purposes and mod4j for connectivity with ModbusTCP protocol.
